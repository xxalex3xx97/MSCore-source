# Changelog

## 0.6.0 - Scan and chunk hold
- **New:** world scan of ships, resource asteroids and stations (`MSCore.scan`, native `MSCore_scan`, Lua `MSCoreNative_scan`). Cached per kind.
- **New:** chunk hold: keep the 3x3x3 chunk cube around a point loaded for an owner (`MSCore.chunks.hold` / `release`, native `MSCore_chunk_hold` / `MSCore_chunk_release` / `MSCore_chunk_ready`).
- **New:** selfcheck checks `scan` and `chunks`, and `scan.api`.
- Native API 3 (was 2). Lua API still 1. Scan and chunk hold are not verified in game yet.

## 0.5.1
- **Fixed:** update checks could show an old version because GitHub caches release files. Checks now always fetch the current manifest.
- **Removed:** `force_install`. Nothing is downloaded or installed unless you click Update / Add / Install. The game only checks and logs "update available".
- Status lines from the in-game loader no longer have a "force" field.
- Manager: Force install column removed.

## 0.5.0 - Mod loader
- **New:** MSCore Manager, a desktop app that finds the game, installs UE4SS + MSCore, and installs / updates / rolls back / removes mods.
- **New:** Add mod from `owner/repo` or any GitHub link.
- **New:** Remove mod removes everything the mod installed (files, UI, paks) and restores originals it replaced.
- **New:** in-game update check at start (log + `MSCore.loader.status()` / `updates()`).
- **New:** SHA-256 + size verification, zip path/type checks, one backup version for rollback.
- Public releases on GitHub (binaries only).

## 0.4.0 - Orders, warp and docks
- Shared native API v2: orders, autopilot, skip-to, filters, warp teleport, arrival and jump cost, sector list, map pin, dock and item lookup.
- Lua API: `orders`, `filters`, `warp`, `docks`, `find_item`.

## 0.3.0 - Ships, commands, steering
- `ships`, `cmd` and `steer` modules (list ships, send commands, aim and throttle).

## 0.2.0 / 0.1.0
- Core Lua helpers: safe object access, UI helpers, tick events, game name resolver, self-check log.
